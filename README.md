This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

This project is done as a simple helper for Advent of Code challenges allowing to run the code in the browser, visualize puzzles and your answers.
This project is not of high code quality and challenges answers are not meant to be optimal.
